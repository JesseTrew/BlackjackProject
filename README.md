## Blackjack Project

### Week 3 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
Use classes to create a functional command line blackjack game. Leave the game's functionality until the end, first get the class structure figured out. From here you can implement methods and fields to store data you think you would need during a blackjack game.

### How to Run
Run from the file Casino.java. Follow on-screen prompts and input requested data.

### Technologies/Topics Used
This project seems to be emphasizing more of the class structure / modular method of programming. 

### Lessons Learned
I'm getting a better hang of the object oriented approach, but I still have a ways to go before it all makes as much sense as I'd like.
